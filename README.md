The goal is to save truck data as its Milage per Gallon (MpG) to count total cost of trip
Its dimensions to figure out the optimal organization of packages in the back (using Genetic Optimization Algorithm)
Drop locations to which these packages are to be delivered so we find the optimal path that connects the desired locations (using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm)
